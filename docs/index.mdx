# Geohash

At Firstclasspostcodes, we use geohashes inside DynamoDB to quickly retrieve matching postcodes for a particular coordinate. Our solution has been adapted from [this original blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/geo-library-for-amazon-dynamodb-part-1-table-structure/) and we've extracted some of the code from an [existing NPM library](https://github.com/rh389/dynamodb-geo.js) to suit our own purposes.

## Install

```
npm i @firstclasspostcodes/geohash --save
```

## Key

We can construct a hash key with the following:

<Embed source={simpleKey} nodeVersion="11" />

This products an object consisting of a _"hash key"_  (`geokey`) and _"hash range"_ (`georange`). This is enough to start storing points, ready for querying within DynamoDB!

## BoundingBox

Let's start testing bounding boxes by determining if a specific point is contained within the matching area of another point. A bounding box is used to produce all the matching geohash ranges for querying points within DynamoDB (or another client).

<Embed source={contains} nodeVersion="11" />

Once a bounding box for a particular center has been constructed, its possible to produce the hash ranges (at a configurable key length) that can be marshalled into requests.

<Embed source={ranges} nodeVersion="11" />

The length of the "hash key" to adopt depends on the data and types of queries you need to work with. Refer to [this blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/geo-library-for-amazon-dynamodb-part-1-table-structure/) for more information.

## Query

Querying for matching points is relatively trivial, but only supports DynamoDB currently. It uses an instance of `AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient` to execute all the necessary queries (a query for each tuple returned from `BoundingBox#hashRanges`). 

Lets take a look at an example below, which provides a pre-configured instance of `DocumentClient`.

<Embed source={query} nodeVersion="11" />

The `docClient` is configured to send the `TableName` and `IndexName` along with every `#query` request.
